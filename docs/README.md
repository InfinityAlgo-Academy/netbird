## Introduction

Wiretrustee is an open-source VPN platform built on top of [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home.

It requires zero configuration effort leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, vpn gateways, and so forth.

There is no centralized VPN server with Wiretrustee - your computers, devices, machines, and servers connect to each other directly over a fast encrypted tunnel.

It literally takes less than 5 minutes to provision a secure peer-to-peer VPN with Wiretrustee. Check our [Quickstart Guide Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWTsGUJAUaU) to see the setup in action.

### High-level overview
In essence, Wiretrustee is an open source platform consisting of a collection of systems, responsible for handling peer-to-peer connections, tunneling and network management (IP, keys, ACLs, etc).
